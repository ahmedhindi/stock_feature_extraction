To quantify a zone we require 3 elements
1. LEG-OUT
2. BASE
3. LEG-IN

Legs: Imply Price Moving (Explosive Moves) Exciting Candles
Base: Imply Price not moving (Non Explosive Moves) Boring Candles

Candlestick composition

Distance from the Open – Close Body of the candle
Distance from the High – Low Range of the candle

Exciting Candle:
Body of the candle > 50% Range of the candle
(Open – Close) > 50% (High – Low)

Boring Candle
Body of the candle <=50% Range of the candle
(Open – Close) <= 50% (High – Low)

Some Important points:
Demand Zones will always have “LEGOUTS” that move “UP”
Supply Zones will always have “LEGOUTS” that move “DOWN”

CTP Notes

Steps to identify Demand Zones:
1. Start with the CMP on the chart
2. Look left and down without cutting through candles to find an explosive move in price
3. Mark a vertical line on the Leg-out candle (A Leg-Out should be made of one Exciting candle or a series of Exciting candles)
4. Candle preceding the Leg-out candle needs to be a boring candle (If the candle is an excitingthen we cannot quantify that zone for that particular time frame)
5. On the Leg-in candle plot a vertical line (Legin should be an exciting candle). Once this is done the base will be completely isolated and go ahead and mark your proximal and distallines.
6. Use the same steps for identifying a Supply zone. The only difference is in the second step and the difference is that we do not have to look down & left, but we have to look up & left.
Additional Rules/Exceptions for the 4 patterns (For plotting Distal Line)
Proximal & Distal line placement for Demand zone
For DBR
Proximal Line – Highest body in the base
Distal Line – Lowest wick of entire formation (DBR)
For RBR
Proximal line – Highest body in the base
Distal Line – Ignore the legin. Lowest wick of base or legout whichever is lower

Proximal & Distal line placement for Supply zone
For RBD
Proximal line – Lowest body in the base
Distal Line – Highest wick of entire formation (RBD)
For DBD
Proximal line – Lowest body in the base
Distal Line –Ignore the legin. Highest wick of base or legout whichever is higher



############################################
1) Run the program for the sample dataset I have put in the shared folder earlier. Each input file shall generate three output files (candle patterns, Demand and supply zone, indicators). The original input file shall be retained. three set of output files shall be put in the folder named 'processed' and shall be prefixed (prefix 'C', 'I' and 'SD' for candles, Indicators and Supply demand file.

2) After you run these, please use 'http://chartink.com/' for verifying the outputs. (indicators, candles, and Demand supply zones)

3)  You need to help me running these programs on my machine. I will do the testing at my end as well.

4) The directory needs to be organized (later). Also, add comments in the program for easy understanding

5) in all programs the input file shall be picked up from the directory and directory name should be read from the parameter file.

Lets have a call on both Friday and Saturday.
